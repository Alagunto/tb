# Improvement Log

This file documents corrections, mistakes, lessons learned, and patterns discovered during development. It serves as a learning resource for the AI agent to progressively improve code quality.

## Template for New Entries

```markdown
## [TIMESTAMP] - [Task Name]

### Issue Fixed
- **Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- **Category**: [Bug/Security/Performance/Quality/Testing/EdgeCase]
- **File**: `path/to/file.ext:line`
- **Original Problem**: [Clear description of what was wrong]
- **Fix Applied**: [What code change was made]
- **Reasoning**: [Why this fix resolves the issue]

### Lesson Learned
[What to do differently in future / pattern to follow]

### Prevention
[How to catch this type of issue earlier in the workflow]

## Example Entry

```markdown
## 2025-10-31 14:30 - User Authentication Implementation

### Issue Fixed
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Category**: Security
- **File**: `auth/handler.go:45`
- **Original Problem**: Password was stored in plaintext in database
- **Fix Applied**: Added bcrypt hashing before storage: `hash, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(password), bcrypt.DefaultCost)`
- **Reasoning**: Plaintext passwords are a critical security vulnerability; bcrypt provides secure one-way hashing

### Lesson Learned
Always hash passwords and sensitive credentials before storage. Never store authentication secrets in plaintext.

### Prevention
Add explicit security rule requiring credential hashing. Include this check in security review workflow.

## Pattern Library

This section extracts reusable patterns from improvement entries.

### Security Patterns

#### Pattern: Credential Storage
**When**: Storing passwords, API keys, tokens, or any authentication credentials
**Do**: Use appropriate hashing (bcrypt for passwords) or encryption (AES-256 for API keys)
**Don't**: Store in plaintext or use weak hashing (MD5, SHA1)
**Example**: See entry [timestamp]

### Performance Patterns

*Patterns will be added as they emerge*

### Testing Patterns

## Notes

- Update this log after every correction cycle
- Review before starting similar tasks
- Run meta-analysis every 50 entries or monthly
- Focus on extracting reusable patterns, not just documenting individual fixes
- The goal is continuous improvement, not perfect documentation
