# TB (Telebot fork)

```bash
go get -u github.com/alagunto/tb
```

# Overview
TB is fork of a bot framework for [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). Find the original named Telebot [there](https://github.com/tucnak/telebot).

I've enjoyed the original design approach and couldn't stand this project being ditched.
